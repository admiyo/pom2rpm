This is a ruby program that will generate a RPM SPEC File based on
THe POM associateed with a package inside a Maven repository.

NOT THE POM YOU USE TO BUILD YOUR PROJECT

It wa sinspired by the gem2rpm script used for Ruby Gems, but shares no code with that project.  

The  format  of theSPEC Files attempts to meet the Standards for Java Packaging set by the Fedora project.
